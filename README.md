## **Enhancement One - Software Design and Development

The artifact that I have selected for the first enhancement is my basic text-adventure game Bletheria. This project was originally created using Python as a single procedural script during one of my first courses here at SNHU. The original version included the full game loop, item collection, a branching storyline depending on the items you have, and a final boss encounter all inside one large file.  Although the game was functional and fun to play, the way it was structured was flat and very difficult to maintain and update. It relied heavily on global variable and large conditional blocks, which ultimately limited scalability and essentially made future expansion exceptionally more challenging to execute.

I selected this artifact because it will allow me to demonstrate my ability to design, build, and enhance a complete software system from the ground up. Bletheria directly showcases my creativity, ability to problem-solve, and foundational programming skills, but most importantly, the enhancements I added for this project show my growth through the program as a capable software engineer. This artifact showcases my ability to create clean and successful object-oriented programming through the creation of classes. It also shows my ability to create clean software architecture using principles like encapsulation and modularity. Finally, this enhancement shows that the code can be extended and maintained through the code which has been structured to support any future enhancements or additions for later enhancements in this course alone. For this enhancement, the artifact was improved significantly by refactoring the entire game from a Python file to an object-oriented class-based Java file.  As stated above, it has been organized into multiple classes that communicate through well-defined methods. This makes the code significantly easier to update, test, and expand which is exactly the type of engineering expected in professional environments.

This enhancement directly meets the course outcomes I had targeted in Module one. My goal for this portion of the capstone was to satisfy Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and professional standards while managing trade-offs involved in design choices. I was able to satisfy this by redesigning the architecture of the game using object-oriented design principles, separating different outcomes between classes, and improving the maintainability. I also partially satisfied Outcome 4: Demonstrate the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices. I did this by porting the program into Java, using modern language features, and preparing the system for future expansions. I also demonstrated the use of industry standards when it comes to design. I do not believe I need to update my plan as this enhancement aligned with what I intended to do for Outcome 3 and sets the foundation for 4 and 5 in future enhancements.

While enhancing this artifact, I have learned a lot about designing software that is both flexible and scalable. Converting my initial Python project into a robust object-oriented Java project required some deep thought on my end when it came to class responsibilities, data encapsulation, and how my objects interacted. In doing this, my understanding of object-oriented design increased significantly beyond basic syntax.
One of the biggest challenges I faced in this enhancement came when I was restructuring the logic I had initially all in one large loop. I had to unwind some of it to make it work in a class-based design. I needed to really think about where certain behaviors belonged like traveling between rooms, item management, and the ending logic. This forced me to think like a software engineer rather than just a programmer.  Another challenge I faced was making sure the new Java version behaved exactly like the original Python game while also following better design principles. 

I believe overall this enhancement strengthened my ability to analyze code that I have already created, plan a complete refactoring, and deliver a cleaner and more professional version of my game. It showcased the importance of organization within code and set a solid foundation for my next enhancements that involve pathfinding, databases, and secure user authentication.
